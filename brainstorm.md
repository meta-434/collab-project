Hi JP

What ideas can we come up with to integrate PHP and something else?

Django? (python)
Flask? (python)

electron (framework) (does support PHP: https://discuss.atom.io/t/what-programming-languages-does-electron-support/27400/4)

let's brainstorm some more ways to give a way to show off php and maybe light python / html / css / JS.
